# Minesweeper
## C# WinForms implementation of minesweeper
Simple C# WinForms implementation of minesweeper. It has all the standard features that you would expect from minesweeper such as random mine placement and working flags. There are four different board sizes which increase both the size of the board and the number of mines within said board; these are 49, 63, 81 and 100.

Standard minesweeper rules apply: 
- Left click tiles to reveal the count beneath them
- The count refers to how many mines are within a 1 tile radius of the tile you clicked
- Right click to flag tiles that you think are mines, you only have enough flags to flag each mine
- You win once all mines have been flagged
- You lose if you left click a mine to reveal it
